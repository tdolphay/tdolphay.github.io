# About Me

I am a 24 year old Computer Science/Physics (Electronics) graduate from Winona State University. I've been able to work at a wide variety of company's ranging the spectrum from debugging and automated analysis of computational physics simulations to helping to create a software interface to interact with microprocessors and FPGA boards. This large difference in necessary skill sets has allowed me to develop a multitude of skills across many fields, including skills related to hardware/software interfaces as well as gaining experience designing and developing systems in both scientific and traditional software devlopment environments.

# Projects

### Winona State CSe Website(#list-header)

During my time at Winona State I was given the opportunity during a web development course to work on a team designing and developing the new version of our school's Computer Science department website (GitHub [here](https://github.com/WSU-CS/CS-Website)). For this project I worked primarily as a back-end developer, working to design and create tools for use by admins, meaning all faculty but mainly focused on professor's. My main responsibility was working on a web application to be used to customize faculty webpages and easily update and maintain faculty information.
